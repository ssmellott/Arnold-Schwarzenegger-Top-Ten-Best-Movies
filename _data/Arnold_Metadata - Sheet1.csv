item1,True Lies,image/jpeg,Arnold1.jpg,"A bit of a controversial choice for number 1, but True Lies is a brilliantly fun ride that subtly spoofs the over the top action genre while still delivering explosive thrills. Arnold Schwarzenegger balances spy swagger with comedic timing, making the absurd situations feel both ridiculous and riveting. It’s a rare action film that laughs at itself and lets the audience in on the joke."
item2,The Terminator,image/jpeg,Arnold2.jpg,"While there is some debate whether Terminator 2: Judgement Day is better than the original, The Terminator is a clear winner for this author. The original hits harder with its raw suspense and unpolished edge. It’s controversial, sure, but Arnold as the bad guy just makes it even better. Fun fact, Arnold did not want to be typecast as the villian, so this is the only movie he plays the antagonist in."

item4,Terminator 2: Judgement Day,image/jpeg,Arnold4.jpg,"Arnold is back and better than ever in this action packed film with more special effects and explosions to make audiences roar!

item5,Predator,image/jpeg,Arnold5.jpg,"While the original Predator didn't score big with critics, it is jam packed with Arnold’s bodybuilding pals, bringing that classic tough guy vibe that the '80s is so well known for. It’s loud, suspenseful, and true to Arnold's style where audiences can't help but root for the muscle bound hero as he survives a cunning predator against the odds. "
item6,The Running Man,image/jpeg,Arnold6.jpg,Arnold in The Running Man plays the tough as nails hero navigating a brutal dystopian society ruled by media and oppression. The film’s satirical sci-fi critiques authoritarian rule with Arnold turning the tables and resisting the system's control.
item7,Conan the Barbarian,image/jpeg,Arnold7.jpg,"Arnold makes a towering debut in Conan the Barbarian, literally!

item8,Jingle All the Way,image/jpeg,Arnold8.jpg,"Jingle All the Way is pure Arnold magic, showing off his unexpected but brilliant comedic prowess as Arnold frantically searches for a Turbo Man for his son.

item9,Pumping Iron,image/jpeg,Arnold9.jpg,"The man, the myth, the legend.

item10,Twins,image/jpeg,Arnold10.jpg,"In Twins, Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers perfect comedic timing alongside Danny DeVito, creating one of the most unexpectedly charming duos in film. Playing the innocent, muscle-bound twin, Arnold proves he’s just as gifted with laughs as he is with action. "
